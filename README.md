# Hazard Game (Terminal) Made With **C**
This game is about find a hidden number between 1 and x (it depends of the level). There are **3** different levels.

 1. First Level : Find a number between 1 and 100.
 2. Second Level : Find a number between 1 and 1000.
 3. Third Level : Find a number between 1 and 10000.

There is also some cool menu "interaction".

Have fun ! ;)
